# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous **Titanic dataset**, conducted using **Python and Matplotlib**. The goal is to uncover key insights about passenger demographics, survival patterns, and relationships between different variables through data visualization.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details, ticket information, and survival outcomes.
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing this data to understand how factors such as **gender, class, age, fare, and embarkation point** influenced survival chances.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** – for data visualization

## 📌 Key Insights

* 💡 Only about **38%** of passengers survived, highlighting the disaster’s severity.
* 👩‍🦱 **Gender played a critical role** – \~74% of females survived compared to only \~19% of males.
* 🏆 **First-class passengers** had significantly higher survival rates than third-class passengers.
* 🧒 Most passengers were between **20–40 years old**, with fewer children and elderly on board.
* 💸 Higher fares were often associated with better survival outcomes.
* 🛳️ Most passengers boarded from **Southampton (S)**, and survival varied slightly by embarkation point.
